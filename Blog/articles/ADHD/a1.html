                    <h1>Understanding the types of ADHD</h1>
                    <p>ADHD is classified into three primary types: Inattentive, Hyperactive-Impulsive, and Combined. Each type impacts individuals in unique ways, affecting their ability to focus, control impulses, and regulate activity levels. Identifying the specific type of ADHD is essential for creating an effective treatment plan, allowing for tailored strategies that address each person's distinct challenges. This distinction helps provide a better understanding of the varied symptoms, leading to more focused and personalized interventions.</p>

                <h2 id="1">Hyperactive, Inattentive, or Both?</h2>
                <p>Have you ever felt like your brain works at a different speed than everyone else's? Do you struggle to stay focused, manage your impulsivity, or organize your thoughts?</p>
                <p>The thing is, the different types of ADHD can be so confusing. Maybe you’re not hyperactive, or you don’t act impulsively. So, do you have ADHD or not?</p>
                <p>Here’s the thing: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can affect everyone in completely different ways. That’s because there are three different types!</p>
                <ul><li><b>Hyperactive-Impulsive</b> types are usually restless and full of energy, often blurting out their thoughts.</li>
                <li><b>Inattentive</b> types are often prone to daydreaming and easily distracted.</li>
                <li><b>Combined</b> types are usually a blend of both types.</li></ul>
                <h2 id="2">ADHD: One Size Doesn’t Fit All</h2>
                <p><b>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</b> is a complex neurodivergent condition that can affect a person's ability to perform daily tasks, deal with school or work environments, and behave in certain situations.</p>
                <p>Everyone experiences ADHD differently, from symptoms to intensity.</p>
                <p>Since the early 1900s, when ADHD was first identified, our understanding was quite limited. However, in the last decade alone, our grasp of the disorder has expanded significantly.</p>
                <p>We now understand that ADHD is a <b>disorder with behavioral symptoms</b>, NOT an attitude problem. </p>
                <p>Experts think that this neurodivergent condition <b>may have something to do with our brain structure</b>. There seem to be differences between brains diagnosed with ADHD and neurotypicals.</p>
                <p>Over the years, we’ve learned a lot, like how it can affect a child's behavior and how it can cause issues in adults, too. Researchers have discovered other common symptoms along the way, too.</p>
                <p>You see, experts first believed that ADHD only affected children who were inattentive and easily distracted. Now, mental health experts can categorize ADHD into <b>three types based on the predominant symptoms.</b></p>
                <h2 id="3">Not Everyone with ADHD is Hyperactive</h2>
                <p>I know - crazy, right? It’s in the name - but it didn’t used to be.</p>
                <p>That’s because earlier versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) used to use the term <b>Attention Deficit Disorder With Or Without Hyperactivity (ADD).</b></p>
                <p>Back then, they didn’t think hyperactivity was a common symptom.</p>
                <p>But when the American Psychiatric Association realized it was, they added hyperactivity. That’s when ADD became ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t until the 4th Edition of the DSM (we’re on the 5th now) that the three different types were recognized. It's now required whenever a qualified mental health professional diagnoses someone with ADHD.</p>
                <p>Today, according to the <b>American Psychiatric Association</b>, to diagnose ADHD accurately, you must meet the criteria of the type you present as. </p>
                <h3 style="color: black;">The 3 Types of ADHD</h3>
                <p><b>ADHD is a complex condition</b> and can be challenging to diagnose.</p>
                <p>I know other people with ADHD who struggle with things I don’t, and vice versa. I need to work on my emotional regulation because I can easily feel triggered, but my friend handles her feelings like a champ!</p>
                <p>We both have <b>ADHD</b>, yet our <b>experiences and symptoms are completely different.</b></p>
                <p>That is where the three types of ADHD can help us understand ourselves better.</p>
                <p>During diagnosis, a mental health professional will assess your symptoms against the DSM-5 criteria and determine which type of ADHD you’re presenting.</p>
                <p>These <b>three ADHD types</b> are:</p>
                <ul><li>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type</li>
                <li>Predominantly Inattentive Type</li>
                <li>Combined Type</li></ul>
                <p>Knowing how your symptoms and traits of ADHD present can help <b>parents, teachers, and mental health professionals better understand your unique experience with ADHD.</b> </p>
                <p>Different types benefit from different treatments, so knowing which criteria you fit into will allow you to properly discuss the course of managing and treating ADHD with your physician.</p>
                <h3 style="color: black;">Diagnosing ADHD</h3>
                <p>Figuring out which type of ADHD you have <b>depends on your experience with the symptoms of ADHD</b> over the last 6 months and how much it impacts your life in multiple areas. </p>
                <p>Your assigned mental health professional may also <b>conduct psychological testing or hold questionnaires and interviews</b>, which can further help assess if you display symptoms of ADHD. </p>
                <p>Some doctors may ask for <b>a detailed family history of medical conditions</b> as ADHD can run in families through genetics.</p>
                <p>After finding out your Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) presentation, it should be easier to understand how it will impact your day-to-day life. A clinical psychologist, or your mental health doctor, can recommend a proper treatment plan and management personalized for your diagnosis.</p>
                <p><b>Behavior therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes</b> are some of the main ways to help people with ADHD.</p>
                <h2 id="4">Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p>ADHD is a complex neurodivergent condition, and manifests differently in everyone.</p>
                <p>There are three main presentations of ADHD, including:</p>
                <ul><li><b>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type</b>: You're always on the go, struggle to sit still, and act impulsively. Common symptoms include fidgeting, blurting out answers, and interrupting others.</li>
                <li><b>Predominantly Inattentive Type</b>: You have difficulty focusing, lose things easily, and tend to daydream. You may be seen as ‘spacey’ or forgetful, but you can also be highly creative and introspective.</li>
                <li><b>Combined Type</b>: You experience symptoms from both the hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive presentations. This is the most common type of ADHD.</li>
                <li><b>The correct diagnosis</b> is crucial for getting proper support and management. A mental health professional will assess your symptoms against DSM-5 criteria and determine your type.</li>
                <li>Whether you have Hyperactive ADHD, Inattentive ADHD, or Combined Type ADHD, the symptoms can be mild to severe and can impact your life in many ways.</li>
                <li>Although there is no cure for this condition, with early intervention, proper management, and lifestyle changes, <b>people with ADHD can still live happy and fulfilling lives.</b></li></ul>
                <p>Sure, getting a diagnosis is no easy feat, but remember that <b>it’s worth it</b>. Getting to know the real you is the first step to being kind to yourself and building the awesome life you deserve, not in spite of your ADHD, but alongside it.</p>
